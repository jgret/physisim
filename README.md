# Physisim

Physisim is a physics simulator written in C++.

## Setup

After cloning the repo, raylib has to be added to the project. To do this quick simply run the setup.ps1 script in powershell. 

Make sure to change to execution policy to enable running unsigned scripts. Enable running unsigned scripts by entering this command as an administrator into powershell.

```powershell
set-executionpolicy remotesigned
```

## Build

After running the setup script, open the solution (physisim.sln).

You can build and run the project with Visual Studio 2022.

The executable will be placed into the bin folder.
